      "By Sean O'KaneCalifornia EV startup Canoo has finally announced pricing for the electric van it announced back in ., The lifestyle van, as Canoo calls it, will start at , and cost as much as , for the most capable model, before additional equipment or tax incentives., Canoo has also started accepting deposits for the van as well as for the electric pickup truck it revealed in March and the delivery van it debuted late last year., Pricing was not given for the pickup, though Canoo has said the base price for the delivery van will be ,., Canoo s lifestyle van is slated to go into production sometime in , though it won t start production on the other two vehicles until at least ., All three vehicles are built on the same modular electric vehicle platform that Canoo has been developing for a few years., In the largest configuration, with an 80kWh battery pack, the lifestyle van should get around miles of range., Canoo also says it will sell the van in four different trims, including an adventure version with more ground clearance and a more muscular profile., Exactly who will build the van remains a mystery Canoo has said it will tap a contract manufacturer, but it has not formally announced one yet., Originally called Evelozcity, Canoo was founded in late by a group of executives and engineers who split off from EV startup Faraday Future, which was struggling mightily at the time., They created the van but also tried to license out the platform it s built on to other automakers and companies looking for a quick solution to bringing an electric vehicle to market., Canoo signed a deal with Hyundai to build vehicles on the platform in and to provide some engineering services to the automaker., And as The Verge first reported in January, Canoo even held talks with Apple about using its electric vehicle platform., That founding group s original goal was to offer the electric van on a subscription only basis, but a lot has changed at Canoo in the last year., The startup merged with a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC and is now publicly traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange, raising some million in the process., Canoo s leadership has also been overhauled., Tony Aquila, a businessman who came in as an investor near the start of the SPAC merger process last year, became Canoo s executive chairman and is now also its CEO after one of the startup s founding executives resigned in April., Aquila has focused Canoo more on the commercial market for electric vehicles since taking power at the startup., He downplayed the subscription model in March, though Canoo does still plan to offer it in some capacity., And he pivoted Canoo away from providing engineering work to other companies, apparently killing the deal with Hyundai., Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily., The Verge is a vox media network Vox Media, LLC., All Rights Reserved\n",
      "By Sean O'KaneAs Faraday Future careened toward what looked like certain doom late last year, the man who was brought in to fix the company s financial woes resigned., He was fed up, according to former employees, with facing resistance from the company s founder and now CEO to his suggestions of how to stop the financial bloodletting., In the weeks that followed, that man Stefan Krause, a former BMW and Deutsche Bank executive remained in negotiations to come back to Faraday Future if certain demands were met., But when the two sides couldn t come to an agreement, Faraday Future issued an excoriating and excruciating public takedown of Krause and CTO and fellow former BMW executive Ulrich Kranz that claimed the two were fired for malfeasance and dereliction of duty., Out of the ashes of that relationship, Krause and Kranz founded what else a new EV startup based in California called Evelozcity, Inc., Krause, who multiple former Faraday Future employees told me last year was often referred to as the company s savior during his time there due to how his ruthless financial efficiency kept Faraday aloft, tried to keep Evelozcity a secret in the months since as he gathered talent and formed a business plan., But a number of former Faraday Future employees split off to fill Evelozcity s early ranks, and a lawsuit quickly put the startup in the spotlight., Faraday Future accused Krause, Kranz, and other former employees of Waymo v. Uber style trade secret theft in the lawsuit, and alleged that the two executives essentially founded Evelozcity with stolen employees claims that the new startup called recklessly inaccurate., With the bandaid ripped off, Evelozcity is now trying to get its own story out there, and the startup made Krause who now runs the show available for interviews last week to a handful of outlets around the globe, including The Verge., During the conversation, which covered both specific and broad strokes of Evelozcity s plan, Krause made it clear he wants to make an affordable electric car with Evelozcity., But he also wants to do much more than that., Three different electric vehicles, all built on the same platformThe company s main goal is to design a skateboard that houses all the battery and electric drivetrain propulsion technology, which will then be shared by three different types of vehicle cabins., That includes a commuter car, a car meant for autonomous ride sharing, and a small van for deliveries., The first Evelozcity designed vehicle Krause won t say which one just yet will come to market in , with the others soon behind., The company will start in the US, attempting to sell the consumer vehicle directly, while pitching the van and ride sharing vehicle to other businesses., Evelozcity will then expand to markets in China and Europe., All three of these vehicles will have a range of at least miles, Krause says, and will also each be built with some high level of autonomy in mind., The company is developing its own battery layout, as well as the software to manage it, but it s already working with outside engineers and suppliers to develop the autonomous technology, Krause says., We have the philosophy to really try to buy as much as we can from suppliers, and source, because that s where we believe the industry will go to more and more, Krause tells The Verge., Suppliers are moving into this space and offering complete solutions., Evelozcity has only had one big design session so far, Krause says, but he already expects the company s vehicles to look much different from EVs that are either on the market or being teased., We want to go away from building an EV that has the look of a combustion engine car., We want to go away from building an EV that has the look of a combustion engine car, he says., If you look at most of the current EVs, they still resemble the architecture of a combustion engine car, with many of them still having a place for an engine, even though there is no engine anymore., This has led to EVs carrying with them the same traditional three box design that has existed since the horse and buggy days, Krause said, where the engine goes up front, the passenger cabin is in the middle, and a storage compartment at the rear., By taking advantage of the extra space usually given to an engine, while also moving most of the car s technology to the skateboard, Evelozcity s designs will have a standout look and more room inside, Krause says., If you don t have an engine in the front, and the front of the vehicle really only deals with crash test requirements, you can think about the looks of the cars quite differently., And you can use the cabin space on top of the skateboard much better., Another way that Evelozcity will be different, Krause says, is that unlike other EV startups like Tesla or Faraday Future, the company won t build its own cars., We believe the future lies in contract manufacturing, and working with partners in terms of the production of vehicles, he tells The Verge., The company s focus is mainly on design and engineering and sales and marketing, not so much on production., The Evelozcity CEO didn t divulge how much funding the company has raised so far, but he said that it is enough to get the company into production., The number it takes to get to the start of production is more or less around billion, he says., Those are the numbers that are floating around for how much you need to go down that path, and it s not dissimilar for us., It s around the same ballpark., Since the company isn t setting out to produce its own vehicles, Krause says he only envisions needing a maximum of around employees by next year., The company is currently at around employees, a group that includes Faraday Future s former design chief, vehicle line head, vehicle engineering director, and head of interior and exterior design trim., The accusations being flung by Faraday Future speak to a larger truth when it comes to acquiring talent in the EV industry while it s still young, it s a hyper competitive market for qualified employees., We re not going after luxury cars, high end sports cars..., we believe the sweet spot in the market is around ,., Krause says Evelozcity has attracted its early employees because the company already has a good strategy laid out, and that he s secured the funding to back it up., I think people are liking our story, he says., We re not going after luxury cars, high end sports cars we re going for a car that hits the sweet spot of the market with a price point that will be competitive below ,., We believe the sweet spot in the market is around ,., It also doesn t hurt that he headquartered the company in California Los Angeles, to be exact , which has become a hotbed for EV startups., Over the last couple of years, there has been a bit of a cluster developing in the EV industry between Los Angeles and San Francisco, Krause says., You find a lot of the suppliers and companies that are dedicated to this space in this area, so you have access to partners, you have many technology companies working on the same things , and you have many startups., Of course, the other side of being in both these physical and figurative spaces is that companies like Tesla or Apple are almost equally likely to poach your staff., Krause says it s expected that Evelozcity will lose some talent along the way., We will have a fluctuation, for sure., We will be targeted, and some of our employees may get good offers., I think it s just an issue that we have to deal with as an industry, he says., I think we will be protected for a while as we develop this and as people are building their resumes, but for sure later it will continue to be competitive., And I tell you that the compensation levels in the EV industry at the moment are certainly rising, and that will continue, especially once the large manufacturers start going after these people as well., Those major auto manufacturers have all made varying commitments to add electric cars to their fleets in the coming years, most of them ranging in the billions of dollars., And there s an express emphasis in these new investments on selling these new EVs and hybrids in Europe and China, where governments are more actively trying to phase out combustion engine cars., Many of these top tier carmakers already sell cars in China, but are also pursuing joint manufacturing ventures with Chinese automakers in order to produce EVs in the country a requirement if they want to tap what is the largest market for electric cars without suffering through high import tariffs., Meanwhile, EV startups pop up seemingly every day inside China as the country s auto industry matures., Some, like NIO or SF Motors, have already made it stateside., China will likely be the leading EV market for a whileKrause wants to sell Evelozcity s cars in China, too, but doesn t think all this competition is limiting., The market will be big enough to see hundreds of companies go to the start line, and then we all will go into the race, he says., If it s a fair competition, the best ones may win, and over time we will see consolidation happening, we will see some companies disappear., For us and our investors, if it s consolidation, that means M A mergers and acquisitions opportunity, that means exit opportunities for investors., It actually means good news., He also says he d be willing to finding partners to work with in China in order to crack the market there by producing within the country s borders., Finding success in China may be the real key for Evelozcity., EV sales are on the rise here, but they only made up ., percent of the overall car market in ., The EV market share in China was three times higher., It s only expected to grow, too percent of the global investment in electric cars is happening in China, and the country is expected to account for percent of global EV sales until ., Meanwhile, the federal EV tax credit in the US narrowly survived being cut out of the recent tax bill, and renewable energy and the subsidies for it has fresh opposition in the highest levels of the government after the election., Krause isn t worried about whether the tax credit will be around when Evelozcity comes to market., And some volatility in the market is to be expected, he explains., What he really worries about is whether or not there is a change in attitude towards EVs when it comes to potential customers in markets like the US., I think over time, if consumers want it, and the people in the country want it, the political reality will adjust to it, he says., This is also where the small delivery van and autonomous ride sharing ideas come in, too., Krause has designed Evelozcity to be flexible in ways that are meant to help the startup survive what is a laundry list of unknowns., But that doesn t mean he s uncertain about whether he s bet on the right ideas., I m looking at will consumers want these products in the future Will there be a strong demand for these types of products in the future And the answer to these questions is definitely yes., And definitely a global yes as well., The name a portmanteau of EV, velocity, and city might take a back seat some dayAsked whether or not Faraday Future is finally behind him, Krause reiterates he can t comment on specifics considering the latest lawsuit., We continue to hire, and we continue to work on our project, and that should tell you that we are not concerned about this, he says., I stand by my statement that these are false and desperate allegations that are being put forward., For us, other than having to deal with some lawyers, it has not been a big distraction., And lastly the company s name, It s a portmanteau of EV, velocity, and city, which Krause says he likes it because it kind of describes, with just the company s name, what we are doing., But even he understands it doesn t exactly roll of the tongue., In time, the company s products, and maybe even its brand name, could be different, he says., Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily., The

a German businessman with ties to Buckingham Palace, and a Chinese tycoon connected to the Communist Party of China., In the complaint, Christina Krause says that despite being a founding employee, she was marginalized and increasingly pushed aside by her husband who allegedly pressured her to sign a postnuptial agreement while he was carrying out an affair., She also claims she was paid less than Canoo s other founding members, despite taking on wide ranging responsibilities, like running communications, heading up HR, securing multiple office spaces, and using her own personal credit line to cover expenses in the startup s early days., The lawsuit may help explain why Stefan Krause recently stepped away from his role as CEO in August, as The Verge previously reported, before Canoo unveiled its first vehicle in Los Angeles on September 24th., The startup s former head of comms and the CEO s wife says she was harassed by her husband, an investor, and othersA spokesperson for Canoo declined to comment on ongoing litigation., Canoo, which was originally called Evelozcity, has grown to around employees since it was founded in late ., It plans to exclusively offer its cars on a subscription basis, and it has claimed to have raised around billion to get the idea off the ground., The origins of that money had been a mystery, but the new lawsuit names David Stern and Pak Tam David Li as its primary investors., Stern is a former business partner and friend of Stefan Krause s, according to the complaint and news reports., He s listed as a director at Pitch Palace, the

meeting in Hong Kong in October , according to the complaint the same month Stefan Krause resigned from his post as CFO of struggling EV startup Faraday Future., Following the meeting, Stefan Krause, Stern, and Li entered into a gentlemen s agreement to start an electric vehicle company, according to the complaint, with Li and Stern provid ing the necessary startup capital., One investor works with Prince Andrew s startup accelerator the other has ties to China s communist partyThe lawsuit does not mention how much money Stern and Li gave to the startup, but it does state that Stefan Krause and fellow Faraday Future defector Ulrich Kranz who also used to work at BMW took annual salaries of , and were each granted ., million shares of stock in the company., Other founding members made at least ,, according to the lawsuit., Christina Krause claims she was given an annual salary of , and a stock option to purchase just , shares in the company., She says she confronted Stefan Krause about how, unlike the other nine members of the company s initial team, she was not named a founder., His response, she claims, was that she was not qualified because her role wasn t critical for the building of the car., She also claims she was given less equity in the company because Stefan Krause told her they would share all of his equity, and to ask for more would be considered greedy., Have

on the phone that he was resigning because she refused to sign the postnuptial agreement., Over the next few days, he allegedly berated her and blamed her for forcing his resignation., As a result, Christina Krause says she went to a hotel for her own safety., Krause says she was pressured to sign a postnuptial before she allegedly discovered an affairOn or around June 11th, Christina Krause

      "Markets Hot Stocks Fear Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Canoo, a California based electric car start up, has revealed its first vehicle a futuristic looking electric vehicle designed to serve as a mobile living room., The van like vehicle, also called Canoo, will be available by subscription only and will not be offered for sale, the company said., The Canoo s design takes advantage of the fact that an electric vehicle doesn t need space to house a big engine and a cooling apparatus., Batteries are in the floor of the vehicle, and the Canoo s box shaped body rides on top of that flat platform., We implemented the Bauhaus philosophy, which is centered around minimalism and functionality, and started with the reduction to the absolute minimal need, Canoo s lead designer, Richard Kim, said in a statement., The Canoo looks like an appliance on wheels., Unlike a sporty performance sedan, it doesn t have design elements expressing speed or agility., Unlike an SUV, nothing about it hints at even slight off road capability., Its blunt ended silhouette is reminiscent of a classic VW microbus., The top of the vehicle, from roughly shoulder height up, is almost entirely glass., Front to back, it s slightly shorter than a Toyota Prius while having much more interior space, the company said., A game changer is coming for electric car owners We call it the post SUV, said Ulrich Kranz, Canoo s acting chief executive, because it offers a commanding seating position, like in an SUV, and pretty much the same space as a large SUV but on a way smaller footprint., Among Canoo s founders were executives who left Faraday Future, another California based electric car start up established in that is still working toward putting out its first production vehicle., Canoo s founding chief executive, Stefan Krause, formerly an executive with BMW and then Faraday, stepped away from directing day to day operations in August but is expected to return to the role, said Kranz., The company is primarily financed by three private investors Kranz would not name, but the company is also reaching out to other investors, he said., Inside the new Canoo, the rear seats are arranged like a sectional sofa along the back and sides., There are even seats that extend from the back doors., The rear side doors swing out like traditional car doors instead of sliding like minivan doors., There is cargo space behind the back seats while larger items like bicycles can be strapped down in the center of the passenger area., The Canoo has fully electronic steering, meaning there is no mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the front wheels., Instead, steering input travels electronically through wires from the steering wheel to the driving wheels., This minimizes the amount of space taken up by steering machinery., It also allows the Canoo to have a rectangular steering wheel., Rectangular steering wheels are common on concept cars but are rare on real production cars because they re awkward to use during tight maneuvers like U turns and parking., A circular wheel is much easier to use in situations where it has to be turned over and over., With electronic steering, though, the front wheels can turn much more for tight, low speed manuevers and less during gentle high speed maneuvers in response to similar steering wheel movements, explained Kranz., There s never any need to turn the wheel completely around., miles in two days., Taking an electric road trip in a Tesla Drivers will use their own phones or tablet devices to handle things like music and navigation, and even to control the vehicle s heating and air conditioning using a downloadable app., The Canoo will have various driver assistance and safety technologies, the company said., It will be equipped with an array of cameras as well as radar and sonar sensors for things like lane keeping assistance, automatic braking and traffic aware cruise control that slows down for cars ahead., Like Tesla, Canoo plans to use software updates to improve the vehicle s capabilities over time., Instead of being sold or leased to customers, the Canoo will be offered by subscription., Subscribers would pay a monthly fee that could include registration costs, insurance, maintenance and charging costs., Customers would keep their vehicle, as with a lease, but they wouldn t have to commit to a set time period., The company still hasn t decided how the fees will be structured or what sorts of plans will be offered., Michigan startup unveils a pricey electric pickup you can take off road Subscription programs are an idea that have been tried, at least experimentally, by a number of luxury car companies including Volvo, Porsche and Mercedes Benz., While appealing in theory, the concept hasn t been broadly implemented so far., The problem with car subscription programs has been that the all inclusive monthly fees tend to be high, said Ivan Drury, an analyst with Edmunds.com., So far, the programs have appealed to only the wealthiest consumers., Rather than operating through retail auto dealers, Canoo will deal with customers directly using mobile apps and websites, said Kranz., The fact that the company won t sell its cars should help it avoid the sort of legal conflicts with established auto dealers that have troubled Tesla in some US states, he said., Canoo plans to partner with a contract auto manufacturer so production of the cars can begin in ., Once the Canoo is in production, the company plans to offer other vehicles that share its

      "By Sean O'KaneHyundai and Kia will build new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by California EV startup Canoo, the companies announced Tuesday., Terms of the deal were not disclosed., Canoo and Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai and Kia s parent company, will develop a new electric vehicle platform that s based on the one that powers Canoo s own vehicle, which was unveiled last year., This EV platform will power small, cost competitive electric vehicles, as well as purpose built vehicles, which would more closely resemble shuttles or even autonomous people movers., Hyundai previously showed off a purpose built vehicle concept at this year s Consumer Electronics Show., Hyundai and Kia each currently sell an electric SUV based off the same platform, and the larger Hyundai Motor Group has promised electric vehicles by .The deal is a significant victory for Canoo, which has only existed for about two years and employs around people., While pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal., Some of the only exceptions to date have been Michigan based startup Rivian, which is working with Amazon and Ford, and Chinese startup Byton, which has a deal with Chinese state owned automaker First Auto Works., Canoo got started after its founders split from Faraday Future in late 2017Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of , when its founders started the company then called Evelozcity after an acrimonious split with famously troubled EV startup Faraday Future., It s really important for us, because having a household name like Hyundai do some work with a startup like Canoo proves that we have a good concept, and a good team, Ulrich Kranz, Canoo s current CEO, told The Verge in a phone interview., Canoo was originally led by Stefan Krause, who served as Faraday Future s chief financial officer following seven year stints as CFO at both Deutsche Bank and BMW., But Krause stepped away from the CEO role last year and is now the company s chairman., Kranz said Canoo spent about a year talking to Hyundai about a deal, and that the South Korean manufacturer repeatedly sent teams to the startup s Los Angeles headquarters to evaluate its progress before signing off., He also said Hyundai will pay Canoo for the work it s doing to get the partnership off the ground, but would not say how much or even whether it s enough to sustain the startup s operations moving forward., He did say that Canoo is still seeking outside investment., Canoo supposedly launched with nearly billion in funding, though it wasn t immediately clear where that money was coming from., Since then, it s come to light that the startup was funded by some powerful men., As The Verge first reported in October , Canoo is backed by David Stern, a director at Prince Andrew s startup incubator, and Pak Tam Li, the head of a massive investment firm in China and the son in law of a man who was once the fourth most senior leader in China., Canoo has also received support from Taiwanese touchscreen supplier TPK, which is run by billionaire Michael Chiang, two people with knowledge of the company s finances tell The Verge., In fact, Canoo s headquarters in Torrance, California is owned by a shell company set up by Foster Chiang, TPK s vice chairman, according to property records., The deal with Hyundai will not impact Canoo s plans to release its own vehicle, Kranz said., The company debuted a subscription only EV in September that is something of a modern take on the VW Microbus., That vehicle, which the company calls the Canoo, is supposed to hit the road in ., Kranz said Canoo has built beta versions of the vehicle so far, of which are fully operational and being tested on both public roads and closed courses., Canoo is building these beta vehicles with a contract manufacturer, which Kranz declined to name., Lots of startups want to partner with OEMs, but few get the chanceLike many other startups, and even some bigger automakers, Canoo developed a so called skateboard for this vehicle that houses the battery pack, electric motors, and other electronics., This neat packaging of all that technology makes it possible to power multiple vehicles using the same adaptable platform, thereby cutting costs., Kranz said that Hyundai liked how Canoo integrated more of the vehicle s technology into the skateboard than some other companies have, which helped secure the deal.,

for good visibility and a space efficient boxy cargo area., There's nary a curve to be found on this thing, but the aesthetic is pretty awesome, and much like the Canoo people mover, it screams vehicle of the future without also screaming science fiction., It's not all about work either., Canoo even has designs that turn the MPDV into an adventure vehicle think part Sportsmobile and part Volvo C303, but electric., This is in addition to having multiple size variants and door opening styles and on and on., The big draws if you haven't guessed it already are its versatility and potential for customization., The other big draw is the price., The MPDV will have a starting retail price of around ,, which is comparable to other more traditional work vans like the base Mercedes Sprinter cargo van and the Ford Transit., Being electric, there are bound to be other cost savings in maintenance and fuel, too, making it probably cheaper to run than other internal combustion vehicles., Of course, the hitch is that Canoo hasn't actually produced any vehicles that are currently available to the public, and it doesn't expect to have the MPDV in limited production until , with full scale production happening in ., There's a lot that can go wrong in that time, but if it's able to pull the whole thing together, Canoo should have an incredibly cool and seriously useful vehicle on its hands.\n",

MPDV2.The Electric Revolution As companies are increasingly pressured by both regulators and consumers to reduce their carbon footprint, the adoption of EVs among commercial delivery vehicles is expected to see a dramatic increase., This shift is projected to be led by the light commercial vehicle segment, an initial target segment for Canoo., The demand for EV light commercial vehicles in the United States, Europe and China is expected to grow at a CAGR from to , according to BloombergNEF.Further, the growth and increase in efficiency of e commerce has resulted in a change in consumer expectations with e commerce providers increasingly pushing to reduce package delivery times from two days to the same day., According to Canoo commissioned research, it is projected that same day parcel delivery volumes in the United States will grow to billion parcels by , reflecting an approximate annual growth rate since ., This change is expected to result in an increase in demand for smaller delivery vehicles that can efficiently execute smaller volume and more frequent delivery routes., The vehicle is built off of Canoo's platform, which has enabled the accelerated design and launch timelines of the company's second vehicle model., Other variations of the multi purpose delivery vehicle will follow, and Canoo plans to announce a service network at a later date., While a number of EV companies have recently announced plans to produce delivery vehicles, the last mile delivery market is an entirely distinct segment and classification of vehicle differentiated from larger and midsize delivery vehicles and trucks., Last mile delivery vehicles operate in predominantly urban environments with diverse use cases, thus requiring a compact size and maneuverability., The vehicles used are generally from the light commercial vehicles segment and a majority of the vehicles are from the class category., These class vehicles carry the same stringent regulatory and crash testing requirements that passenger cars are subjected to., Canoo's platform, which is specifically designed for class vehicles, has been validated to support these crash requirements via its passenger vehicle program., This provides Canoo a significant competitive advantage as most of the players in the commercial vehicle space have not crash tested their platforms given their focus on larger sized vehicles., Following its U.S. commercial debut, Canoo will look to launch the multi purpose delivery vehicle in other markets such as Canada, Mexico and Europe., Customers looking for

InvestingBest IRA AccountsBest Roth IRA AccountsBest Investing AppsBest Free Stock Trading PlatformsBest Robo AdvisorsIndex FundsMutual FundsETFsBondsA new Los Angeles based electric vehicle startup founded by veterans of Canoo and QuantumScape said Wednesday it's preparing to shake up the medium duty truck market with a ready to build electric truck platform coming next year., The company, called Harbinger, has developed two EV platforms it says are optimized for medium duty trucks such as delivery vans., The platforms use motors and other technology developed in house specifically to meet the needs of a market segment where trucks are expected to be in service for up to years far longer than the average passenger car., It's a market segment that so far, at least hasn't been well served by the industrywide move to electric vehicles, CEO John Harris said., The companies out at the bookends, in the light duty and heavy duty space, are historically highly vertically integrated, Harris told CNBC in an interview., When we look at the medium duty industry, it's completely different., Harris said that medium duty trucks, which fall between light duty pickups and heavy duty semitrucks, are generally highly specialized., Those trucks, which can range from dump trucks to delivery vans, are typically built to order for fleets by companies called upfitters, using chassis from any of several established vehicle makers., It's an ecosystem that hasn't changed much in the last years, Harris said., That's why Harbinger is tailoring its products to work within that existing medium duty ecosystem., The company is preparing two fully electric truck chassis that will be ready for upfitters to tailor to their commercial customers' needs at a cost that, Harris said, will be comparable to existing internal combustion options., Harbinger's products will include a cab chassis similar to those built by companies like Ford Motor, but electric., Upfitters use cab chassis, which come with a passenger compartment, to build box trucks, tow trucks and other similarly sized vehicles., Harbinger will also offer a strip chassis, without a cab for the driver, that can serve as a foundation for vehicles like delivery vans., Harris noted that unlike existing strip chassis options, Harbinger's won't require upfitters to work around an internal combustion engine allowing for more cargo room and a more comfortable environment for the vehicle's driver., And because they're expected to serve for up to years, both of Harbinger's chassis will include the hardware and redundant systems needed for autonomous driving., Harbinger, though, has no plans to develop its own self driving software in house., What isn't clear yet is how the company plans to manufacture its chassis., Harbinger's headquarters has tooling and equipment to build prototypes, and can produce electric motors and related parts, but it's not equipped to build complete chassis at scale., Harris told CNBC that Harbinger has selected a manufacturing partner and will announce details soon., Harbinger currently expects to make its first deliveries in late and to begin volume production in , he said., Harbinger was founded in July by Harris, who worked at EV startups Faraday Future and Xos Trucks Phillip Weicker, who serves as Harbinger's chief technology officer and worked at QuantumScape and Canoo, where he was a cofounder and Will Eberts, chief operating officer, who worked with Harris at Faraday Future and with Weicker at Canoo., The company received early funding from Tiger Global Management and other highly specialized investors with deep experience in electric vehicles, Harris said., Harbinger plans to show off its EV truck chassis at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit later this week., Got a confidential news tip We want to hear from you., Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inboxGet this delivered to your inbox, and

      "Canoo s deal with Hyundai Kia announced last year appears to have fallen flat., New Canoo chairman Tony Aquila broke the news last Monday during an icy investor call, as The Verge reports., The collapse is set against a backdrop of a strategy change at Canoo., The Californian start up seems to want to keep their skateboard platform to themselves and sell vehicles to fleet operators rather than selling the EV technology to third parties., That is the positive reading from the company s first investors call that saw the CEO missing from the briefing and a CFO having resigned the second major departure in recent weeks following Canoo losing its head of corporate strategy, according to The Verge., What s more, between the lines, it sounded as if there were disagreements with the Korean group about Canoo s intellectual property., These are significant surprises on the call today, and that s not ideal, The Verge quotes Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin saying at one point on the call., Canoo had announced the deal with Hyundai in February , and it was supposed to result in both the Hyundai and Kia brands building vehicles on Canoo s electric vehicle platform., Canoo, only two years old at the time, called it a key partnership with the industry considering it a major sign of trust in the company s tech., Albert Biermann, Head of Research Development, Hyundai Motor Group, said at the time, the company would collaborate with Canoo engineers to develop a cost effective Hyundai platform concept that is autonomous ready and suitable for mass adoption., Hyundai has yet to comment on today s news., Canoo did not respond beyond the initial statements by the new chairman Aquila., The chairman did add in the call that the startup s board of directors decided to de emphasize its engineering services the part of Canoo s business that was supposed to see it provide technology to bigger companies that wanted to enter the electric vehicle space., The executive also said I think it was a little premature, when asked about partnerships directly., The California based startup appears to have also taken a step back from the original plan to sell its unveiled electric minibus via a subscription model., After that, Canoo had unveiled two other EV concepts in the form of a multi purpose delivery vehicle and a pickup truck which they now seem to want to sell directly., We have so much demand for our three vehicles , let s get all that work done, and then let s, you know, look at if there are partnerships, Aquila said according to The Verge., The company has seen a lot of change recently., Canoo s previous Chief Financial Officer Paul Balciunas will be succeeded by Renato Giger on an interim basis., Canoo cofounder Ulrich Kranz appears to still be CEO after his partner Stefan Krause had left the company already although his contract is allegedly under revision., The Californian eMobility start up Canoo formerly Evelozcity announced its IPO in August ., The company has entered into a definitive agreement with the investment firm Hennessy Capital Acquisition to merge for the purpose of an IPO., The SPAC deal was completed last year.theverge.comYour email address will not be published., Required fields are marked Name E Mail I agree with the Privacy policy We have been covering the development of electromobility with journalistic passion and expertise since ., As the industry's leading specialist media, we offer comprehensive reporting of the highest quality as a central platform for the rapid ramp up of this technology., With news, background information, driving reports, interviews, videos as well as advertising messages., electrive.com\n",
      "LOS ANGELES, April , PRNewswire Canoo Nasdaq GOEV Canoo or the Company , today announced the appointment of Tony Aquila, its Executive Chairman and one of the Company's largest investors, to the added role of Chief Executive Officer., In this position, Mr. Aquila will lead the Company in its focused strategy of bringing the Company's best in class electric vehicles EVs to the masses., Canoo is a Los Angeles based mobility technology company developing breakthrough, purpose built EVs with a proprietary and highly versatile multi purpose platform architecture., Along with Mr. Aquila's appointment as CEO, the Company announced the opening of executive offices in Dallas., California will remain the home of the Company's concept development, including design and engineering., Mr. Aquila succeeds Ulrich Kranz, who has resigned effective April , ., Mr. Aquila has told the Board that he will forego any additional cash compensation and instead since he so believes in the future of the Company take the added compensation in Canoo stock., Mr. Aquila, through a controlled investment vehicle, invested in Canoo in August and December .Separately, the Company has appointed Hector Ruiz as General Counsel., Mr. Ruiz succeeds Andrew Wolstan, who resigned effective April , ., Mr. Ruiz was promoted following his successful tenure as Vice President Global Strategy, Tax Counsel, and Treasury., The entire Board is pleased and excited that someone with Tony's background, track record and vision has agreed to lead the Company, said Thomas Dattilo, a member of the Board of Directors and Chairperson of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee., I've seen first hand what Tony can accomplish., We are confident the Company will benefit from Tony's extensive experience in creating and leading high growth companies, both private and public, as we enter this critical stage in our growth., Tony has a proven commitment and vision for deploying electric vehicle technology for the benefit of working Americans., His passion for Canoo's multi purpose platform being deployed to increase jobs and worker productivity, as demonstrated by the fully electric pickup truck, can be a game changer benefitting the environment and the American economy, said Director Ambassador Josette Sheeran, a member of the Company's Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee., I am fortunate to have already been working with the Company when Tony arrived and have witnessed his dynamic leadership and clear vision for how best to ensure Canoo works in partnership with America's most brilliant engineers and software technologists for a long and prosperous future., Mr. Aquila joined the Canoo board as Executive Chairman on December , ., He was previously elected chairman on October , ., In looking at any company, I start with the product and people first, Mr. Aquila said., In fact, I invested in Canoo because of the technology associated with the multi purpose platform, their engineering team and the market opportunity the Company has to bring EVs to everyone., I see tremendous upside in this Company., We are focused on aligning the business to best meet the greatest market demand., Mr. Aquila said that shortly after taking on the role of Executive Chairman, he began working with a team of internal and external experts to do a comprehensive analysis to determine how to best optimize Canoo's growth opportunities and maximize its shareholder value., This deep dive showed, as I suspected, that the product is this Company's future, he said., Mr. Aquila has guided the improvement in the design and development of the Company's fully electric pickup truck and believes the vehicle will play a significant role in the Company's growth., The production version of the pickup truck will open for preorders in Q2 , with deliveries beginning as early as .As previously announced, the pickup truck is the third vehicle that will be based on the Company's proprietary multi purpose platform architecture, enabling the accelerated development timeline., Canoo's EV platform functionally integrates all the critical components of an electric powertrain to be as flat and efficient as possible., Traditional EV platforms have power units, shock towers and mechanical steering columns that protrude into the vehicle and take up space., By incorporating steer by wire and other space saving technologies, Canoo's thin platform, with no need for an engine compartment, allows the Company to offer a flatbed size comparable to America's best selling pickup truck on a smaller footprint., This makes the vehicle easier to maneuver and more convenient to drive and park in any terrain., It was exciting to see the market response when we introduced the truck, with the most impressions we've ever received to date, more than . billion., People are genuinely excited and so are we, Mr. Aquila said., We are incredibly proud of what we have created and are confident this truck will set the standard for all EVs., Mr. Aquila said the Company has added to its Board and C Suite and expects to complete the build out of the executive team over the next several quarters., As part of the new strategic plan developed following the analysis by internal and external experts, the Company is shifting manufacturing into two phases, Mr. Aquila said., In phase , as previously announced, we will use contract manufacturing to launch production of the MPP1 LV derivative., We will announce the selection of our partners shortly., In phase , we will move forward on our mega micro factory where we will build our MPP1 and certain high volume derivatives., We are in advanced discussions with a number of governors and their teams about the location and believe this move will result in the creation of approximately , good paying jobs., The Company will soon narrow down this selection to a final group of states, Mr. Aquila said., We have brought in an experienced world class team who have negotiated billions of dollars in incentives for high tech companies, including automotive manufacturing, he said., We sought proposals focused on the areas of geography, labor force, educational systems, supportive infrastructure and the desire to build out an EV infrastructure in their states., The Company's strategy will be focused on protecting and maximizing the value of its intellectual property, Mr. Aquila said., Due to the expansion of our derivatives and the best return on capital, and following the comprehensive analysis by internal and external experts to maximize shareholder value, it was decided by our Board to deemphasize the originally stated contract engineering services line, he said., In addition to protecting our IP, this will further accelerate the creation of IP and the launch of our derivatives, which in turn will enhance our opportunity for the highest return on capital., Once this is complete, it will allow us to commercialize the three vehicles we have announced our pickup truck, our multi purpose delivery vehicle or MPDV1 and our lifestyle vehicle., All of which sit on our multi purpose platform, which we call MPP., Mr. Aquila believes the value proposition of the Company's EVs is already significant and will play an important role in consumer selection., We don't have to wait for EV technology to become economic for consumers, Mr. Aquila said., It already is, which is why our business model and our design is made for the delivery and tradespeople who rely on their vehicles for work the people who build America., These people are putting on significant daily mileage, which makes the total cost of ownership of an electric vehicle favorable, compared to an internal combustion ICE vehicle., In fact, the average commercial vehicle travels , miles per year., According to our estimates after , miles of driving, an EV breaks even compared to an ICE vehicle on a Total Cost of Ownership, or TCO, basis., Notably, there are million commercial and mobility working people vehicles on the road today that would benefit economically by switching to an EV., Given the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the need to lower per mile cost of delivery, it is clear that the EV market opportunity is huge, he said., It is not surprising that OEMs, EV players and others such as technology companies are positioning themselves to compete in the massive shift to EVs., We are building a Company focused on democratizing access by providing EVs to the masses, not the elite, Mr. Aquila continued., I am pleased that we remain on track for a launch and have developed a product with fewer parts, one that is completely harmonized and repairable, creating an asset that will create the highest residual values., In June , Mr. Aquila founded AFV Partners, an affirmative low leverage capital vehicle that invests in long term mission critical software, data and technology businesses and has served as its Chairman and CEO since its founding., In , Mr. Aquila founded Solera Holdings Inc., and led it as Chairman and CEO to a billion initial public offering in , and in the following years sourced and executed over acquisitions significantly expanding Solera's total addressable market., Mr. Aquila oversaw Solera's ., billion transaction from a public to private business in ., During his tenure, Mr. Aquila established Solera as a global technology company that provides software and data to global insurance companies, global OEMs and maintenance, repair and overhaul networks., It was a great pleasure and experience for me to help start this Company in and see it grow, Mr. Kranz said., A successful startup is only possible with a dedicated, motivated and professional team like the one we have at Canoo., As the Company is now publicly listed with a great new leadership team in place, now is the time for me to move on., I wish the Company great success., About CanooCanoo is a Los Angeles based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles that are reinventing the automotive
