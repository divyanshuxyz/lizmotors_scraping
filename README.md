**Project Title:** Querying Scraped Data using Google PaLM

This project aims to build a system for:

1. **Scraping data:** Extracting relevant information from online sources.
2. **Database creation:** Storing the scraped data in a structured format.
3. **Question answering:** Enabling users to ask questions about the data using Google PaLM, a large language model.

**Key technologies:**

* **Web scraping:** Tools and libraries for extracting data from websites.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Techniques for understanding and processing the scraped text data.
* **Database management:** Storing and querying the structured data.
* **Large Language Model (LLM):** Google PaLM for answering natural language questions about the data.

**Project setup:**

1. Install necessary libraries for web scraping, NLP, database management, and Google PaLM API access.
2. Configure the scraping workflow to target specific websites and extract relevant data points.
3. Define the database schema and populate it with the scraped data.
4. Set up the question answering interface using Google PaLM to process user queries and access relevant information from the database.

**Getting started:**

* Refer to the project documentation for detailed instructions on setup, configuration, and usage.
* Explore the codebase to understand the implementation of each component.
* Feel free to modify and adapt the project to your specific needs and data sources.

**Disclaimer:**

* Web scraping should be conducted ethically and in accordance with website terms and conditions.
* Google PaLM access may require specific permissions and usage limitations.

**Further information:**

* Include links to relevant documentation, tutorials, and API references.
* Mention any specific data sources or use cases the project is designed for.
